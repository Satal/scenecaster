# Licensing

## SceneCaster

SceneCaster is licensed under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Remotion

SceneCaster uses [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) for video composition and rendering. Remotion has its own licensing terms that depend on your team size:

### Free use

**Individuals and companies with 3 or fewer people** can use Remotion for free under the [Remotion License](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

### Company licence required

**Companies with 4 or more people** need a [Remotion Company License](https://www.remotion.pro/license). This applies to the total number of people in your company, not just those using SceneCaster.

See [remotion.pro](https://www.remotion.pro) for pricing.

## FAQ

**Does the Remotion licence apply to me?**
If you're an individual or a team of 3 or fewer, Remotion is free. If your company has 4+ people, you need a Remotion company licence.

**Is the Remotion licence per-project or per-company?**
Per-company. One licence covers all your Remotion usage.

**What if I use SceneCaster in CI/CD?**
The same licensing applies. The Remotion licence is based on your company size, not where or how the software runs.

**Where can I learn more?**
See the [Remotion licensing FAQ](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/license) for full details.
